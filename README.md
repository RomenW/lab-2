# Lab2

## Romen Warren

# Problem:

Often we go to restaurants or grocery stores and buy things. There is always a cost for the goods we buy, which is often known as `price`, and often there is tax associated with what we buy. The tax is determined by `taxRate`.

In this problem you have to use the `lab2.py` file and complete the problem so that the user can enter the `price` as float and `taxRate` as float as well. Then you need to compute `tax` and `total` price for the `price` a user enters.


# Hints:
- In this problem you are to use `input` to take keyboard input and compute `tax` and `total`.
- The `tax` needs to be calculated
- The `total` is a sum value and you need to calculate it.
- No need to change the print statements
